Given the definition of hate speech as any form of communication in speech, writing, or behavior that attacks or
uses pejorative or discriminatory language with reference to a person or a group based on who they areâ€”specifically 
their religion, ethnicity, nationality, race, color, descent, gender, or other identity factor-consider the following sentence:
First, let's identify if the sentence attacks or uses pejorative or discriminatory language towards 
a person or a group based on their identity. This involves looking for any language that might promote, 
spread, or incite hatred, discrimination, or hostility against a group or individuals belonging to the 
group based on specific factors like religion, ethnicity, nationality, etc.
If the sentence does include such language, it can be considered as hate speech, and thus, the classification 
would be "Toxic". If it does not contain such language and does not attack or demean any person or group based 
on their identity, then it is not hate speech, and the classification would be "Non-Toxic".
Let's analyze and classify the sentence accordingly.
